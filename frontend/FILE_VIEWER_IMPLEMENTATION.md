# File Content Viewer Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive file content viewer system that detects file paths and commit hashes throughout the DiffSense frontend and makes them clickable to open detailed popups.

## Components Implemented

### 1. API Integration (`src/services/api.js`)
- **getFileContent**: Get file content at specific commit or HEAD with optional diff view
- **getFileHistory**: Get complete commit history for a specific file with optional diffs
- **getCommitFiles**: List all files changed in a specific commit with diff stats
- **compareCommits**: Compare two commits or specific files between commits

### 2. FileViewer Component (`src/components/FileViewer.jsx`)
A modal popup that provides:
- **File Content View**: Shows file content with syntax highlighting
- **Diff View**: Toggle to show git diffs with red/green highlighting
- **History Navigation**: Navigate through file commits using forward/backward buttons
- **Commit File List**: When viewing a commit, shows sidebar with all changed files
- **Consistent Theming**: Matches the maximized chat window design
- **Navigation**: Click through file history, jump between commits

### 3. FileViewer Context (`src/contexts/FileViewerContext.jsx`)
Global context providing:
- **openFile(repoId, filePath, commitHash)**: Open file viewer for specific file
- **openCommit(repoId, commitHash, filePath)**: Open commit viewer with file list
- **openFileViewer(config)**: Generic opener with full configuration
- **Global State Management**: Manages viewer state across the entire app

### 4. LinkifyContent Component (`src/components/LinkifyContent.jsx`)
Detects and linkifies:
- **File Paths**: Detects common file patterns (src/main.js, components/Header.jsx, etc.)
- **Commit Hashes**: Detects 7-40 character hexadecimal Git commit hashes
- **Clickable Buttons**: Renders detected patterns as styled, clickable buttons
- **Color Coding**: Purple for commits, blue for files
- **Smart Detection**: Avoids false positives with context-aware regex

### 5. Integration with ChatInterface (`src/components/ChatInterface.jsx`)
- **Message Linkification**: All chat messages now have file paths and commits linkified
- **MarkdownRenderer Integration**: Wraps markdown content with LinkifyContent
- **Source Links**: File paths in source citations are clickable
- **Commit Hash Links**: Commit hashes in analysis results are clickable
- **Repository Context**: Passes repoId to enable linkification

## Features Implemented

### File Viewer Capabilities
1. **Content Display**: Shows file content with line numbers and syntax highlighting
2. **Diff Viewing**: Toggle between content and git diff view with red/green highlighting
3. **History Navigation**: Browse through file's commit history chronologically
4. **Commit Integration**: View all files changed in a specific commit
5. **File Selection**: Click through different files from commit file list
6. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Detection Patterns
The system detects:
- File paths: `src/main.js`, `components/Header.jsx`, `utils/api.js`
- Directory paths: `src/components/`, `lib/utils/`
- Commit hashes: `abc1234`, `1a2b3c4d5e6f7890` (7-40 hex characters)
- Context-aware: Avoids false positives in URLs, numbers, etc.

### User Experience
1. **Seamless Integration**: Works throughout the app without breaking existing functionality
2. **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects and color coding for different link types
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Support for keyboard shortcuts and focus management
4. **Loading States**: Shows loading indicators during API calls
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for invalid files/commits

## Usage Examples

### In Chat Messages
When users type:
- "Check src/components/Header.jsx" → "Header.jsx" becomes clickable
- "Commit abc1234 broke the build" → "abc1234" becomes clickable
- "The utils/api.js file needs updating" → "utils/api.js" becomes clickable

### In API Responses
- Source citations automatically become clickable
- Commit analysis shows clickable commit hashes
- File paths in breaking changes are clickable

### File Viewer Navigation
1. Click file path → Opens file content viewer
2. Toggle "Show Diff" → Switches between content and diff view
3. Navigate commits → Browse file history chronologically
4. Click commit hash → Opens commit file list viewer
5. Select different file → Switches to that file's content

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Context-based**: Uses React Context for global state management
- **API-driven**: All data fetched from backend REST endpoints
- **Modular**: Separate components for viewer, linkification, and context
- **Performant**: Lazy loading and efficient regex matching

### Integration Points
- App.jsx: Wrapped with FileViewerProvider
- ChatInterface: Enhanced with linkification
- MarkdownRenderer: Supports repoId parameter
- Any component can use useFileViewer() hook

### Styling
- Consistent with existing DiffSense theme
- Dark/light mode support
- Responsive design
- Accessibility features

## Future Enhancements
1. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add shortcuts for common actions
2. **Search in File**: Add search functionality within file content
3. **Bookmarking**: Save frequently accessed files
4. **Split View**: Compare two files side-by-side
5. **Blame View**: Show git blame information
6. **Mini-map**: Overview of file structure for large files

## Testing
The system has been tested for:
- File path detection accuracy
- Commit hash recognition
- API error handling
- Modal display and navigation
- Theme consistency
- Mobile responsiveness

This implementation provides a powerful and intuitive way for users to explore repository content directly from chat conversations and analysis results.
